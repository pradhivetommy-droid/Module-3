# Strings-Palindrome Check in Python (Without Built-in Functions)

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the string `"google"` to a variable.
2. Reverse the string manually using slicing (`[::-1]`).
3. Compare the original string with the reversed string.
   - If they are equal, print that the string is a palindrome.
   - Otherwise, print that it is not a palindrome.
4. Execute the program.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
s = input()
rev = s[::-1]

if s == rev:
    print(f"{s} is a palindrome")
else:
    print(f"{s} is not a palindrome")

```
## Output

## Result
A Python program to check whether the string `"google"` is a **palindrome** or not, without using built-in palindrome checking functions was completed successfully and output was generated.
